Sharing the idea and details of the implementation of Poisson distribution based noise maker is quite a job. Due to lack of base support of Poisson distribution random number generator, a float number and the range of the floating number is quite interesting topic. The final result turns out to be a integer generator with a scaling shifting. Hence, we can satisfy our purpose and simplify the implementation at same time.

\subsection{Machine Learning}

%Ran talks about filtering here...
The origin plan includes another distributed memory system based classifier, which is distributed Support Vector Machine (SVM). However, after three weeks of work, the result turns out to be unacceptable. The implementation of distributed SVM contains a large number of interfaces that allows user to train and test the result. However, the only function our project needs is not supported after parsing the SVM Light files. The decision between continuing the work to implement a corresponding function and stop to switch focusing on other object becomes quite controversial. Due to time limit and tight schedule of my last three weeks. Lacking of machine learning knowledge, I spend too much time studying on basic concept of SVM. The lesson I learnt is to better schedule the timeline and estimate the workload for a totally new area.
