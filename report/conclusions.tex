\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusion}
This report covers our work on a distributed logistic regression classifier to predict atom locations given CCD images.  We implemented a parallelized raytracer to simulate a large number of images that we then preprocessed to create out training and testing.  Successfully implemented and tested our distributed logistic regression classifier using the training and testing data to achieve 100\% accuracy.  Finally, we produced several visualizations to demonstrate classifier efficacy and parallel performance.
