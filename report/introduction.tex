\section{Introduction}

The Steck Lab is investigating the motion of a single atom in a Magneto Optical Trap (MOT).  The atom is imaged using a pair of aspheric lenses and a CCD camera.  Given an 2D image from the CCD, the lab wants to predict the probability distribution of the atom's location within the MOT. Our project accomplishes this goal through several stages of design and development, which include data generation, data preprocessing, classification, and prediction.  A subgoal of our project is to design parallel and distributed algorithms to increase performance and enable scalability.

This report describes our efforts to both simulate atom images, and to create a scalable probabilistic classifier capable of atom location prediction.  Section \ref{design} provides an overview of our system design and objectives.  We discuss the details of our development and implementation efforts in Section \ref{development}.  Experimental results are outlined in Section \ref{experiments} followed by an discussion of the lessons learned in Section \ref{lessons}. We conclude the report in Section \ref{conclusion}.
