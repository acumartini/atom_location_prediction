\section{Introduction}

The Steck Lab is investigating the motion of a single atom in a Magneto Optical Trap (MOT).  The atom is imaged using a pair of aspheric lenses and a CCD camera.  Given an 2D image from the CCD, the lab wants to predict the probability distribution of the atom's location within the MOT.

This report describes our efforts to both simulate atom images, and to create a scalable probabilistic classifier capable of atom location prediction.  Section
