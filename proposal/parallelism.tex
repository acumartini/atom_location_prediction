\section{Parallel Plan}

The Diffyq design includes several places to introduce and explore/optimize parallelism.

\begin{description}
\item[Data and Program Marshalling] Map Stenciling...
\item[Stenciling Management] Communication minimization along borders...
\item[Node Level Parallelism] Matrix Multiplication...
\end{description}

%We plan to look at system scaling by varying the number of initial objects in the simulation and the number of cannons available. We intend to look at wall clock time to complete a fixed number of simulation steps. We also intend to look at latency between the FOSA transmission time and BDS receive time to see if pipelining provides a significant benefit.

%If we have extra time, we would like to explore using MPI to spread the simulator and AKWDS computations across nodes to increase the size of simulation that can be done in realtime.
