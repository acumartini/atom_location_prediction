\section{Project Schedule}

\begin{tabular}{c | p{14.2cm}}
Week & Deliverable\\
\hline
5 & PETSc PDE solver installed and running data runs OR raytracing implementation generating data runs, \par identify parallel classifiers and get them running on ACISS. \\ 
6 & Get classifiers working on ACISS and extend/create code based on prediction goals. \\ 
7 & Process initial data ouput to identify best classifiers based on performance and accuracy. \\ 
8 & Finalize and optimize simulations and classifier code.\\
9 & Create visualizations, do performance analysis, begin writup and presentation. \\
10 & Finalize writeup and presentation.\\
